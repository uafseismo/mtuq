Uncertainty visualization
=========================

MTUQ provides utilities for visualizing full moment tensor, double couple, force, hypocenter, and depth uncertainties.

Brief descriptions of all these plotting functions can accessed through the library reference links below.


Passing misfit values 
---------------------

Importantly, one input argument common to all visualization utilities is a data structure `ds`, which is expected to contain source parameters and corresponding L1 or L2 misfit values. 

`ds` can be either of the following data types:

- an `MTUQDataFrame` (for irregularly-spaced grids)

- an `MTUQDataArray` (for regularly-spaced grids)

As it happens, `mtuq.grid_search` returns these data structures automatically, with no additional user effort required.


It happens that `ds` can also be either of the two parent classes, since subclass methods are not actually necessary for visualization:

- a pandas `DataFrame` (for irregularly-spaced grids)

- an xarray `DataArray` (for regularly-spaced grids)



Data structure requirements
---------------------------

Before doing anything else, plotting utilities check that the given data structure `ds` contains the expected parameters.

What is expected varies depending on the utility.  For example, full moment tensor utilities expect the following paraemters: `rho`, `v`, `w`, `kappa`, `sigma`, `h`.

To see which parameters are expected in a particular case, look for functions named `_check`  within `mtuq/graphics/uq/`.



Converting misfit values to likelihoods
---------------------------------------

All plotting utilities expect L1 or L2 misfit values, which must be passed through the input argument `ds`.  

Some utilities then take these misfit values and convert on-the-fly to maximum or marginal likelihoods.

*Current limitations*

- only Guassian likelihood functions are implemented, which means that only L2 misfit values are accepted

- a diagonal covariance matrix, specified by the input argument `sigma`, is used to convert misfit to likelihood; off-diagonal covarience matrices are not yet implemented



Output image formats
--------------------

In all plotting utilities, the output image format is determined from the extension of the given filename.  If the extension is missing or unrecognized, the format defaults to PNG.



Library reference links
-----------------------

For plotting L1 or L2 misfit values:
- plot_misfit_lune
- plot_misfit_vw
- plot_misfit_dc
- plot_misfit_force
- plot_misfit_xy
- plot_misfit_depth


Converts L2 misfit values to likelihoods, then plots maximum likelihoods:
- plot_likelihood_lune
- plot_likelihood_vw
- plot_likelihood_dc
- plot_likelihood_force
- plot_likelihood_xy
- plot_likelihood_depth


Converts L2 misfit values to likelihoods, then plots marginal likelihoods:
- plot_marginal_lune
- plot_marginal_vw
- plot_marginal_dc
- plot_marginal_force
- plot_marginal_xy
- plot_marginal_depth
